# LemonGDPS website
Nothing to brag about - except it looks cool, it feels cool, it isn't empty and is pretty light and understandable in code so you don't mess up this time.

## How to install
1. Clone the directory somewhere.  
  1.1. You can use Git: `git clone https://github.com/stysan/lemon`. (Recommended)  
  1.2. You can use GitHub's official CLI: `gh repo clone stysan/lemon`.  
  1.3. You can do it all by yourself, downloading the ZIP file and extracting it. (Recommended for noobs)  
2. Open a local server in the directory.  
  2.1. You can open a local server using Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 42069`.  
  2.2. There are also plenty of VSCode extensions for live servers.  
3. Open your browser and visit [this link](http://localhost:42069).
4. You can safely edit the code, if you can call it so - this website uses no JavaScript and PHP at all.
